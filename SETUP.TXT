You have to follow these steps to get a project up and running:

# WINDOWS - VISUAL STUDIO
-> Create a new project (I recommend Empty Project)
-> Put this folder somewhere you can #include the LSWv5.h
-> Open Nuget, browse for Allegro and install
-> Open project properties, then:
  * General > C++ Language Standard: C++17
  * General > C Language Standard: C17
  * Allegro 5 > Add-ons: "Yes" on all items
  * Allegro 5 > Library Type: "Dynamic Debug" for DEBUG and "Static Monolith" for RELEASE
  * C/C++ > Code Generation > Runtime Library: /MT and /MTd for RELEASE and DEBUG
  * C/C++ > Code Generation > Floating Point Model: Fast (recommended)
  * Linker > General > Additional Libraries Directory: Add the "LIB\x64" to the "x64" and "LIB\x86" to the "Win32"
